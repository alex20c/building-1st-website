                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>At AleCode we believe strongly in small business growth. As an option to help scale a business to a bigger customer
                base, we created AleCode. A key part in success is proper marketing techniques as well as evolving with modern day
                technology. So, we started to help businesses or organizations create an enchancing website to provide business info,
                business hours, ways to contact the business, advertise your products and help draw more attention to the business.
                In pursuing that, we also wanted to offer a website layout to show off your skills and expereince to employers with
                a personal website. This will help draw attention from employers to understand your knowledge, experience in the field,
                and skills. We want to help businesses, organizations, and even you as a human grow as a group or individual and have a
                modern-day, proffesionally made website to enchance performance. Our #1 goal is GROWTH!
